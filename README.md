# Cryptocurrency-Historical-Data-Downloader

A tool that downloads and stores historical price and volume data for various cryptocurrencies.


In this example, we I used the CoinGecko API as a reliable source for historical cryptocurrency data. We will use the requests library to make API calls and pandas to store the data in a structured format.

__Install Required Libraries__

Make sure you have the required libraries (requests, pandas) installed before running the code. You can install them using the following commands:

pip install requests pandas

In this code, we define a class CryptocurrencyHistoricalDataDownloader, which encapsulates the functionality to download historical cryptocurrency data using the CoinGecko API.

The download_historical_data method makes an API call to CoinGecko's /coins/{id}/market_chart/range endpoint to fetch historical data for the specified cryptocurrency.
We format the start and end dates using the format_date method to match the required format for the API call.
The API response is parsed, and the historical data is stored in a pandas DataFrame. We convert the timestamp to a pandas datetime object and set it as the DataFrame's index for further analysis.
Finally, the downloaded data is saved to a CSV file named "bitcoin_historical_data.csv" in this example.
You can modify the example to download historical data for other cryptocurrencies or use different data sources if needed. Always ensure that you have permission to use and access the chosen data sources.
